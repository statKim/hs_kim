abstract: <h4>Purpose</h4> The correlation between the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and tuberculosis or bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination rate in individuals aged <15 years was investigated using worldwide data. <h4> Methods </h4> The incidence of T1DM, rate of BCG vaccination, and incidence of tuberculosis were obtained from the Diabetes Atlas 9th edition of the International Diabetes Federation and the Global Health Observatory data repository of the World Health Organization. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and population data by country were obtained from the World Bank and United Nations, respectively. <h4> Results </h4> GDP per capita negatively correlated with the incidence of tuberculosis and positively correlated with the incidence of T1DM (coefficient=-0.630 and 0.596, respectively; all P<0.001). The incidence of T1DM and tuberculosis was significantly associated with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) status (P<0.001). After adjusting for GDP per capita, regional grouping, and OECD status, the incidence of T1DM negatively correlated with that of tuberculosis (R2 =0.729, P=0.009). However, there was no association between the BCG vaccination rate and incidence of T1DM (P=0.890). <h4> Conclusions </h4> There was a negative correlation between the incidence of tuberculosis and T1DM in children and adolescents aged <15 years at the country level.
