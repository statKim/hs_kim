- Developed a web application that predicts the congestion level of major tourist destinations named "눈치싸움 대작전" by "다섯명", a five-member team.

- Developed the web server using Python module flask, and constructed the database using sqlite3.

- Constructed the LightGBM model to predict the congestion level of the places using foot traffic data from SKT.

- The source codes of the program is available on https://github.com/statKim/Da_Vinci_SW_Hackathon.
