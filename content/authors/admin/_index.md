I am a Ph.D. student from [Department of Statistics](http://stat.cau.ac.kr/) at [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr/), under the supervision of [Prof. Yaeji Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/yaejilim).
I am also a member of the [Multivariate Statistics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/yaejilim).
Prior to that, I received my M.A. in Statistics and B.A. in Applied Statistics at Chung-Ang University.

My research interests include Functional Data Analysis, Non-Euclidean Data Analysis and Statistical Dimension Reduction.
Currently, my main research work includes developing functional clustering and quantile based dimension reduction method for Riemannian functional data.

I love R coding and making documents using Rmarkdown.
I sometimes write on [my personal blog](https://statkim.github.io/) about Statistics, R, etc.

<!--
I have broad research interests in methodology and theory in causal inference, reinforcement learning, graphical model, and their interchanges, to establish reliable, powerful, and interpretable solutions to wide real-world problems. Currently, my main research work includes individualized optimal decision making with complex data, policy evaluation in reinforcement/deep learning, and causal discovery for high-dimensional individual mediation analysis, directly motivated by precision medicine, customized economics, personalized marketing, modern epidemiology, etc.
